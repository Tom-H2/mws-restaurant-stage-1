# Restaurant Review Project
This project represents the work of Thomas Harris a required feature of the Udacity FEND Curriculum. The code is completed by me and attribution is given either in comments or in the Sources section found below.

## To Access this Project

1.Open a terminal, and spin up a Pythong server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
2. With the server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
3. The page will open to "index.html" page titled "Restaurant Reviews".
4. From here the user can navigate to the "restaurant_info.html" page that holds the reviews for each restaurant.
